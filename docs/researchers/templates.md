# Experiment templates

Experiment templates allow you to quickly create new experiments based on pre-defined configurations. You can use built-in templates or create your own.

## Loading a template

When building an experiment, you can load a template to populate the stages and settings.

1.  In the experiment builder, click the **Load template** button in the top header.
2.  Browse the gallery of available templates:
    *   **Recommended**: Includes "Quick Start" templates (e.g., Blank, Group Chat, Private Chat) and other default templates.
    *   **Owned by me**: Templates you have created.
    *   **Shared with me**: Templates shared with you by other researchers.
3.  You can search for templates by name or description using the search bar.
4.  Click on a template card to apply it to your current experiment. **Warning: This will overwrite your current stages and settings.**

## Saving a new template

You can save your current experiment configuration as a new template for future use.

1.  In the experiment builder, click the **Save as template** button in the top right corner.
2.  Enter a name and description for your template.
3.  Click **Save**.

## Updating a template

If you have loaded a template that you own and have made changes, you can update the original template.

1.  Load a template you own.
2.  Make your desired changes to the stages or settings.
3.  Click the **Update template** button in the top right corner.
4.  Confirm the update in the dialog.

## Deleting a template

You can delete saved templates that are no longer needed.

1.  Click the **Load template** button in the top header to open the gallery.
2.  Navigate to the **Owned by me** tab.
3.  Find the template you want to delete.
