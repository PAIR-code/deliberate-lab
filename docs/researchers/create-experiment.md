After setting up the experiment stages and settings, use the button in the top
right corner to save your experiment. This will make it available
from the home page gallery.

## Edit or fork experiment
To edit an experiment, click on its card in the home page gallery.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

At the top left of the experiment dashboard, fork or
view/edit settings for the current experiment.

For creators: general
experiment configurations (e.g., metadata, permissions, delete experiment)
can be edited at any time, but stages can only be adjusted if no cohorts
currently exist in the experiment.

Non-creators cannot edit the experiment metadata/stages, but they
can click the top left settings icon to preview the configurations.

## Preview experiment

> Coming soon: Simplified workflow for previewing an experiment

To preview or test your experiment, create a new cohort and add
a participant, then use the "participant preview" panel (or copy that
participant's experiment link) to see the participant's view.
Once you're done, delete the cohort to enable editing experiment stages.
