You can use Prolific to recruit participants for your Deliberate Lab
experiment.

## Add Prolific redirect codes to Deliberate Lab

First, when setting up your experiment, navigate to the "Prolific integration"
tab.

  alt="Screenshot of Prolific panel in Deliberate Lab experiment editor"
/>

Copy your redirect code(s) from the Prolific platform and paste into the
Deliberate Lab field(s).

<img

  alt="Screenshot of Prolific platform showing places to copy redirect codes"
  style="max-width: 500px"
/>

The default completion code is required; you can optionally add redirect codes
for failed attention checks or blocked participants.
These help manage participants in Prolific.

## Add Deliberate Lab link to Prolific

After creating your experiment, create a cohort and copy the link.
Paste this link into your Prolific experiment:

<img
  src="../assets/images/prolific-add-cohort-link.png"
  alt="Screenshot of Prolific platform showing place to paste experiment URL"
  style="max-width: 500px"
/>

Participants will be redirected to Prolific after completing or being booted
from your experiment.
