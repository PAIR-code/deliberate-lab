First, navigate to the experiment.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

After creating a new cohort, use the copy button to copy the cohort link
and share with experiment participants.

As participants click to join the experiment, they'll appear in the
experiment dashboard under the cohort (left panel). Click on a specific
participant to view details in the right panel.

## Transfer participants

After clicking on a specific participant, use the "Transfer" dropdown
at the top of the right panel to transfer that participant to a different
cohort.

The participant will visually be sorted under the new cohort, but they
must explicitly click to "accept transfer" in order to become active
in the new experiment.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

> Note: If a participant is currently in a "Transfer" experiment stage,
a "Ready for transfer" status chip will appear in the left panel.

## Boot participants

Use the "boot" button to manually remove participants from their cohort and
experiment.
