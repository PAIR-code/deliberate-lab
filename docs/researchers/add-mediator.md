When configuring your experiment, make sure you have a group or private
chat set up (you can use the cards at the top of the home page
to quickly create a chat-based experiment).

Then, navigate to the "Agent mediators" tab and set up a persona for your
mediator.

> ⚠️ Make sure you have an API key set for the API that your
mediator will use!

Below persona settings such as display name and API/model, you'll
see a list of stage-specific prompts. Make sure that you have prompts
added to the stages where your mediator will be active.

Note that in the prompt editor, "stage context" includes everything
the participant will see in that stage (e.g., for chat stages, chat
history and list of chat participants).
