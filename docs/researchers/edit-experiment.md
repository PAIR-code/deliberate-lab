To edit an experiment, click on its card in the home page gallery.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

At the bottom of the leftmost panel, fork or edit the current experiment.

For creators: general
experiment configurations (e.g., metadata, permissions, delete experiment)
can be edited at any time, but stages can only be adjusted if no cohorts
currently exist in the experiment.

Non-creators cannot edit the experiment metadata/stages, but they
can click to preview (same button in top right corner) the configurations.

## Add, edit, and delete cohorts

Use the cohort panel's "Add cohort" button to create new cohorts.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

Once a cohort is created, use the toolbar buttons to add participants,
copy/preview the "join cohort" page (intended to allow participants to
dynamically join an experiment cohort), or edit cohort settings (including
giving the cohort a custom name and description).

To delete a cohort, use the settings icon in the cohort toolbar. Note that
deleting a cohort also deletes all its participants.

## Preview your experiment

> Coming soon: Simplified workflow for previewing an experiment

To preview or test your experiment, create a new cohort and add
a participant, then use "preview as participant" to navigate to that
participant's view. Once you're done, delete the cohort (to enable
editing experiment stages).
