const BBOT_AGENT_PROMPT = `You are Bridging Bot, the moderator for an online chat conversation between two participants about the topic of abortion rights.
Your job is to intervene in the conversation exactly once. When you do intervene, you should send a message that summarizes or restates the feelings and attitudes expressed by the two participants in the conversation so far in clear, neutral, and constructive terms that are mutually comprehensible to both parties. If you can clearly and concisely explain where and why the conversation participants are disagreeing, please do so.
The purpose of this intervention is to (1) reflect back the perspectives expressed by others in the conversation so far, (2) help shift any negative framings into more neutral terms, and (3) clarify any terms or phrases that might be misunderstood. It is okay for participants in the conversation to disagree; your job is to help make the disagreement productive.
You should be deeply thoughtful, empathetic, and clear in your response; keep in mind that you are speaking directly to both participants in the conversation. Be sure that you do not seem like you are putting words in the mouths of participants, being condescending, or telling them what they believe. Use cautious rather than certain language; for example you could use phrasings like: “[Participant Name], it sounds like you are expressing [Emotion], and that [Belief]”.
You should not express any personal beliefs or feelings about abortion, abortion rights, or any other topics. You should not bring any new facts or opinions into the conversation. You should focus only on summarizing what the other conversation participants have said so far.
If you would like to intervene in the conversation, respond with the message that you would like to send only (no timestamps or metadata). This will be sent immediately to the participants in the chat conversation. If you do not wish to intervene, respond with an empty string. If you have intervened in the conversation previously, you should not respond again.`;

**Researchers:** Jeffrey Fossett: Harvard University, Ian Baker: UC Berkeley
**Sponsors/Supporters:** Plurality Institute, Jigsaw

We are a team of researchers investigating ways to improve the quality of online discussions. You are being invited to participate in a technical pilot to improve the design of a research project that will be conducted in the future. Results from this pilot will not be published.

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to have a text-based conversation about abortion and reproductive rights with another research participant who disagrees with you on this issue. An AI bot will also be present in the chat, and may interject in the conversation from time to time. Researchers will be able to see the content of your messages, but they will never be shared outside of the research team.

If you proceed, you will be asked to complete a survey, followed by a chat conversation, and then an additional survey. You will be paid at the rate specified on Prolific when you have completed the second survey.

This study will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. With your permission, we may contact you for a further paid followup study opportunity. Participation in that study is optional, and your payment for this study is not contingent on your agreement to participate in future research.

A single individual may not participate in this study more than once. You will be ineligible for payment if we detect that you attempted to participate a second time.

**Risks and Benefits**

A risk of taking part in this study is the possibility of a loss of confidentiality or privacy. Loss of privacy means having your personal information shared with someone who is not on the study team and was not supposed to see or know about your information. The study team plans to protect your privacy. Their plans for keeping your information private are described in the Confidentiality section.

You may or may not receive personal (direct) benefit from taking part in this study. The possible benefits of taking part in this study include an opportunity to debate or learn new information about an issue that may be important to you.

**Privacy and Confidentiality**

Your privacy and confidentiality of your responses are of paramount importance both to us and to our universities. We do not collect information about your identity, and we cannot re-contact you except through the Prolific platform. Your conversation transcripts and survey answers will never be shared outside the research team. Please contact us if you have any doubts or concerns.

The researchers listed above will be able to look at, copy, use, and share your research information.

**Participant's Rights**

Participation is voluntary. Refusal to participate or withdrawing from the research will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you might otherwise be entitled.

**Contact Details**

If you have any questions, doubts, or would like us to remove your data from our database, please contact Jeffrey Fossett at jeff@plurality.institute.

By selecting “I accept the terms of service” below, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and a resident of the United States, and that you agree to participate in this research study.`;
