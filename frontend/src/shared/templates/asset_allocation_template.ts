Welcome to the Investment Portfolio Allocation demonstration!

In this study, you'll:
1. **Review stock information** for two different companies
2. **Analyze performance data** including charts and key metrics
3. **Make investment decisions** by allocating a $1,000 portfolio between the two stocks
4. **Confirm your allocation** before proceeding

**Your Task:**
You have $1,000 to invest and must decide how to split it between two stocks. You can allocate anywhere from 0% to 100% to each stock, but your total allocation must equal 100%.

**Important Note:** This demonstration uses entirely fictional companies and simulated data. This is for demonstration and research purposes only. The information shown does not constitute financial advice and should not be used for actual investment decisions.
